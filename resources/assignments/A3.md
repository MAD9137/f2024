# Assignment A3

**Objective:**  
Develop a location-based social app using SwiftUI that incorporates the new topics added to the syllabus. The app should demonstrate mastery of REST APIs, data binding, MapKit, Core Location, animations, MVVM architecture, and Firebase integration (Auth, Firestore, and Storage).

**App Overview:**  
Create a "SwiftSocial" app where users can create an account, share location-based posts (with text and images), view posts on a map, and interact with other users' posts. The app will utilize REST APIs for external data, MapKit for location-based services, Core Location to get the user's current location, animations for smooth transitions and interactions, and Firebase for user authentication and data storage.

**Requirements:**

1. **Core Functionality:**
   - **User Authentication:** Implement user registration and login using Firebase Authentication. Allow users to sign up and log in using their email and password.
   - **Post Creation:** Allow users to create posts that include text, images, and their current location. Use `@State` and `@ObservedObject` to handle form inputs and state management.
   - **Display Posts:** Fetch posts from Firebase Firestore and display them in a list view as well as on a map using MapKit. Use `@Published` to update the UI when new posts are fetched.
   - **Map View with Annotations:** Use MapKit to display user posts on a map with annotations. Customize annotations to display a thumbnail image of the post.
   - **User Location:** Use Core Location to fetch and display the user's current location on the map. Provide a feature to center the map on the user's location.
   - **REST API Integration:** Fetch additional data from a REST API (e.g., weather data based on the user's location) and display it within the app. This can be displayed as an overlay on the map or as a separate section in the post detail view.

2. **Advanced SwiftUI Features:**
   - **Data Binding and State Management:** Use `@State`, `@Binding`, `@EnvironmentObject`, `@ObservedObject`, and `@Published` to manage state and data flow in the app. Ensure proper use of data binding to maintain consistency between the model and the view.
   - **Animations:** Implement both implicit and explicit animations for user interactions such as creating a post, deleting a post, or transitioning between views. Use advanced animation techniques to enhance the user experience.
   - **MVVM Architecture:** Structure the app using the MVVM pattern. Ensure that each view is backed by a ViewModel that handles the business logic and state management.
   - **Firebase Firestore and Storage:** Store post data in Firebase Firestore and images in Firebase Storage. Ensure that data fetching and saving are efficient and optimized for real-time updates.

3. **User Interface:**
   - **Post List View:** Display posts in a list view using `List` or `ScrollView` with dynamic data from Firebase.
   - **Post Detail View:** Show detailed information for each post, including text, image, location on the map, and additional data from the REST API.
   - **Custom Map Overlays:** Use custom overlays in MapKit to display additional data (e.g., a weather overlay based on REST API data).
   - **Interactive Elements:** Allow users to tap on map annotations to view more details about a post, including options to like, comment, or share.

4. **Data Handling:**
   - **User Data:** Store user information securely using Firebase Authentication.
   - **Posts Data:** Define a `Post` model class or struct with properties like `id`, `title`, `content`, `imageURL`, `latitude`, `longitude`, and `timestamp`.
   - **SwiftData:** Optionally use SwiftData to cache user data or post data locally for offline access.
   - **Network Handling:** Handle REST API requests and responses using `URLSession`. Parse JSON responses using the `Codable` protocol.

5. **Additional Requirements:**
   - The app should be optimized for both light and dark mode.
   - Follow best practices for SwiftUI development and Firebase integration.
   - Use Git for version control with meaningful commit messages showing the project's progression.
   - Ensure the app handles errors gracefully, including network errors, authentication errors, and data handling errors.

6. **Submission:**
   - Push your final project to your GitHub account in a repository named `MAD9137-SwiftSocial`.
   - Include a `README.md` file with a brief description of your app, setup instructions, API usage, Firebase configuration steps, and any known issues or future improvements.

**Grading Criteria:**

- **Functionality (35%):** The app meets all core functionality requirements, including REST API integration, Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Storage.
- **Code Quality (20%):** Code is well-structured, follows Swift and SwiftUI best practices, and is well-documented.
- **UI/UX (15%):** The app provides a user-friendly interface and a smooth user experience.
- **Data Binding and State Management (10%):** Correct use of SwiftUI data binding techniques and state management.
- **MapKit and Core Location (10%):** Proper implementation and use of MapKit and Core Location for location-based features.
- **Git Usage (5%):** Demonstrates regular and meaningful commits to the GitHub repository.
- **Creativity and Extra Features (5%):** Additional features or creative elements added to the app beyond the basic requirements.

**Deadline:** Submit your project by the end of Week 14. Late submissions will be penalized according to the course policy.

Good luck, and enjoy building your location-based social app with SwiftUI!
