# Assignment A1

**Objective:**  
Develop a SwiftUI app that utilizes the topics covered in the MAD9137 weeks 1 to 7. The goal of this assignment is to build a functional app using SwiftUI that demonstrates mastery of Swift basics, flow control, collections, optionals, functions, classes, structs, enumerations, generics, and SwiftUI components.

**Requirements:**

1. **App Overview:**  
   Create a simple recipe app called "SwiftRecipe" where users can view, add, and manage their favorite recipes. Each recipe should include a title, description, ingredients (as a list), steps (as a list), and a recipe image. Users should be able to navigate between a list of all recipes and a detail view of each recipe.

2. **Core Functionality:**
   - **List of Recipes:** Display a list of recipes using `List` and `NavigationLink`. Each list item should show the recipe title and a short description.
   - **Recipe Detail View:** Display the full details of a selected recipe, including the title, image, ingredients, and steps.
   - **Add Recipe Feature:** Allow users to add a new recipe. This view should include text fields for the title, description, ingredients, and steps, as well as an option to add an image.
   - **Edit and Delete Recipes:** Provide the ability to edit or delete a recipe from the list.
   - **Filter Recipes:** Implement a filtering feature that allows users to filter recipes by a specific criterion, such as a keyword in the title or ingredient. The filtering should update the list dynamically as the user types in the filter field.

3. **SwiftUI Components to Use:**
   - Utilize `Text`, `Image`, `TextField`, `Button`, `List`, `NavigationLink`, and `Form` to build the app UI.
   - Use `Stack` views (`VStack`, `HStack`, and `ZStack`) to layout the views.
   - Implement `Modifiers` to style the text and images (e.g., font, color, padding).
   - Incorporate `Alert` for confirmation when deleting a recipe.
   - Use `ScrollView` to handle the display of recipe details if the content is too large to fit on the screen.

4. **Data Handling:**
   - Store recipes in an array of custom `Recipe` structs. Each `Recipe` should have properties like `title: String`, `description: String`, `ingredients: [String]`, `steps: [String]`, and `image: UIImage?`.
   - Use optional binding to safely handle optional values like the recipe image.
   - Use functions to add, edit, and delete recipes from the array.
   - Demonstrate the use of optionals and unwrapping optionals when handling the image data for recipes.

5. **Swift Language Features:**
   - Demonstrate your understanding of Swift basics (variables, constants, types, control flow).
   - Use `if`, `switch`, `for`, `while`, `guard` statements where applicable.
   - Implement a higher-order function (`map`, `filter`, or `reduce`) to manipulate the recipes list (e.g., filtering recipes by a certain criterion).

6. **Additional Requirements:**
   - The app should follow best practices for SwiftUI development, including the use of MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.
   - Use Git for version control. Make regular commits to a Git repository to show the progression of your work.
   - Ensure your app works in both light and dark modes in iOS.

7. **Submission:**
   - Push your final project to your GitHub account in a repository named `MAD9137-SwiftRecipe`.
   - Include a `README.md` file in your repository with a brief description of your app, instructions for running it, and any known issues or features youâ€™d like to add in the future.

**Grading Criteria:**

- **Functionality (40%):** The app meets all core functionality requirements.
- **Code Quality (20%):** Code is well-structured, follows Swift and SwiftUI best practices, and is well-documented with comments where necessary.
- **UI/UX (20%):** The app provides a user-friendly interface and a smooth user experience.
- **Git Usage (10%):** Demonstrates regular and meaningful commits to the GitHub repository.
- **Creativity and Extra Features (10%):** Any additional features or creative elements added to the app beyond the basic requirements.

**Deadline:** Submit your project by the end of Week 9. Late submissions will be penalized according to the course policy.

Good luck, and happy coding!
