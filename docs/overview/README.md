## Plagiarism Policy

Plagiarism is defined as defined as presenting someone else’s work, in whole or in part, as one’s own, and includes the verbal or written submission of another work (for example, ideas, wording, code, graphics, music, and inventions) without crediting that source. This includes all electronic sources (for example, the Internet, television, video, film, and recordings), all print and written sources (for example, books, periodicals, lyrics, government publications, promotional materials, and academic assignments), and all verbal sources (for example, conversations and interviews).

Plagiarism, whether done deliberately or accidentally, is not allowed. The facilitation of plagiarism, that is, one student sharing his or her work with other students, is also not allowed. All parties caught plagiarizing will receive a **ZERO**.
