## The Date class

In order to use the Date class, you must import the foundation classes at the top of the .swift file like so:

``` swift
import Foundation
```

:::tip NOTE
The UIKit library also imports the Foundation library.  If your class imports the UIKit library you do NOT need to import the Foundation library as well.
