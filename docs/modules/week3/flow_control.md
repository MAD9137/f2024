# Flow Control

Swift has all of the expected **flow control** statements ( **if**, **while**, **for** and **switch** ) that one expects. However, each has its own unique Swift way of writing them. There are creative differences in the syntax for each control statement, and instead of do-while and for-each loops Swift has an equivalent **repeat-while** and **for-in** loop statement.

## If & If-Else statements

If and If-Else statements in Swift look quite similar to the way they are written in other languages.

<!-- INSERT IF and IF-ELSE SNIPPET -->
<<< @/docs/.vuepress/includes/snippets/if.swift

## While & Repeat-While Loops

The while loop will look similar to other languages you have seen before, but instead of a do-while look, Swift has a repeat-while loop.  The following code demonstrates this.

<!-- INSERT WHILE LOOP SNIPPET -->
<<< @/docs/.vuepress/includes/snippets/while.swift

[Swift Developer Docs](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ControlFlow.html#ID124)

## For & For-In Loops

Swift has a slightly different way to write loops.  For loops look similar to other languages, but instead of a for-each, Swift uses a For-In notation.

<!-- INSERT FOR LOOP SNIPPET -->
<<< @/docs/.vuepress/includes/snippets/for.swift
