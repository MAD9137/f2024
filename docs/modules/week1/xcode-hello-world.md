# Hello World

If you followed this week's instructions and have installed Xcode correctly, you should be able to run a simple 'Hello World' application.

This is a screenshot of the application running in the simulator, with the Xcode project in the background:

**To run the application:** [Download the HelloWorld project here](/F2020/assets/downloads/HelloWorld.zip), unzip it and double-click on the `.xcodeproj` file to open it in Xcode.  From the toolbar, press the run/play button.

:::warning NOTE
The first time you run the iOS simulator, it may take a while to load.
