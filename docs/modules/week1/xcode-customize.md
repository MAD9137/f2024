# Customizing Xcode

## Displaying line numbers

By default, Xcode does not display line numbers.

To turn on this functionality, go to *Xcode-> Preferences*, and open the **Text Editing** tab.

Check the box for â€œLine numbers", and close the window.

## Fonts and colours

In the **Fonts & Colors** tab in the *Preferences*, you can change the fonts and the colour scheme of the text editor.

Here are some videos to help acquaint yourself with Xcode before you continue:
