# ðŸ§  Developing with Apple

## Apple Developer Program & Developer Account

When developing for iOS, you need two things to release an app:

1. an Apple Developer Account, and,
2. a membership in the Apple Developer Program.

An **Apple Developer Account** will be needed to deploy to your device and, eventually, to release your product. It's free and takes a few seconds to create.

In order to test your application on an iDevice the free membership is fine, but in order to sell your application on the App Store you must enroll in the **Apple Developer Program**. You can register as an individual, or as a company/organization. A membership normally costs $99 per year, however the College has included this cost in your tuition.

::: warning Note
If you do not already have your Apple Developer Account, please contact your course coordinators.
