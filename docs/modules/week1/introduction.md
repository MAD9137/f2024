# Course Introduction

iOS is the operating system that Apple released in the summer of 2007 with the release of the iPhone Generation One.  It is a UNIX based operating system and was created using C, C++ and Objective-C.

The overall goal of this class is to impart a working knowledge of how to build iOS applications using Xcode, coding with the Swift language.  It will cover the fundamentals of the software and registration required, building applications in Xcode, testing projects in the iOS simulator and deploying to the device.  It will also give you an understanding of Apple's app approval process.

We will be using the Swift coding language in Xcode to develop iOS applications.

**NOTE:**   **This course will be using the most current versions of macOS, Xcode and Swift available at the start of the semester.**

## Basic Requirements

For this course you need to have the latest version of macOS running on your laptop.  You can check what version of operating system you are running currently by doing the following:

1- Click the Apple icon in the upper left corner of your screen
2 -Click "About This Mac"

If your laptop has an older operating system, [click here to learn how to upgrade](https://www.apple.com/ca/macos/how-to-upgrade/).  Here is a little check list of things to consider in order to upgrade you computer safely:

* Backup all your personal files to an external hard drive
* Create a TimeMachine restore point
* Download the newest macOS from the App store
* Upgrade to the newest macOS

## Xcode

To develop for iOS [you will need to download Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835), an integrated development environment (IDE) similar to Microsoft's Visual Studios.  Xcode lets you write and compile C, C++, Objective-C and Swift code into applications that run on iOS, watchOS, tvOS and macOS.  As stated above you will be using the newest version of Xcode and Swift for development in this course.

**NOTE:** **If a new version of Xcode (and Swift) comes out during this semester and you choose to upgrade, you will be accepting the responsibility to learn any new syntax in Swift, and any new Xcode layouts.  If you do not wish to update then make sure you have automatic updates turned off.  This is done by opening up the App Store on your laptop, select App Store -> Preferences and uncheck 'Install app updates'.**

## External Resources

In addition to the in-class lessons and the material posted on Brightspace, we will be using two external sites for videos, lessons, and interactive learning resources:  Pluralsight and LinkedIn Learning.

### Pluralsight

You should already have access to [Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com) from the College.  If you cannot access Pluralsight, please contact your course coordinators.

### LinkedIn Learning

You should already have access to [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) from the College.  If you cannot access LinkedIn Learning, please contact your course coordinators.
