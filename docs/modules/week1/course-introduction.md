# üß† Course Introduction

iOS is the operating system that Apple released in the summer of 2007 with the release of the iPhone Generation 1. It is a UNIX based operating system created using C, C++ and Objective-C.

The overall goal of this class is to establish a working knowledge of how to build iOS applications using Xcode, the Swift programming language and SwiftUI to build interfaces. It will cover the fundamentals of the software and registration required, building applications in Xcode, testing projects in the iOS simulator and deploying to a physical device. It will also give you an understanding of Apple's app approval process.

The course is divided into two parts. The first will focus on learning the Swift programming language and the development environments followed by building native iOS applications using Swift and SwiftUI in Xcode and Swift Playgrounds.

::: warning Note
Apple tends to release new hardware, operating systems and development tools during the fall of each year with developer and public betas available prior to general availability. Please ensure that current major releases available at the start of the semester are installed and functioning on your machine.

## Basic Requirements

While we all want to explore the latest and greatest alpha and beta releases, we also need to maintain stability to ensure the success of students. Please review the following notes to ensure you have the right tools and versions installed.

## macOS

For this course, please have the latest public release of macOS 13 (Ventura) running on your machine. You can check what version of operating system you are running currently by doing the following:

1. Click the Apple icon in the upper left corner of your screen 
2. Click ‚ÄúAbout This Mac‚Äù

If your laptop has an older operating system, [click here to learn how to upgrade](https://www.apple.com/ca/macos/how-to-upgrade/). Here is a little check list of things to consider in order to upgrade you computer safely:

Backup all your personal files to an external hard drive
Create a TimeMachine restore point
Download the newest macOS from the App store
Upgrade to the newest macOS

## Xcode

To develop for iOS you will need to [download Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) an integrated development environment (IDE) similar to Microsoft's Visual Studio. Xcode lets you write and compile C, C++, Objective-C and Swift code into applications that run on iOS, watchOS, tvOS and macOS. As stated above you will be using the newest version of Xcode and Swift for development in this course.

::: tip Can I use VSCode instead?
You should stick with Xcode for iOS app development because it is the official integrated development environment (IDE) provided by Apple, ensuring seamless compatibility with their ecosystem and access to the latest features and updates. Additionally, Xcode offers comprehensive tools, including Interface Builder, Instruments, and SwiftUI previews, making it a robust choice for building, testing, and debugging iOS apps.

## Swift Playgrounds

Swift Playgrounds is a new light-weight development environment for learning how to build Swift apps. It is available for iPadOS and macOS and while it is possible to release an app to the app store, it is ideally suited for learning Swift and SwiftUI without the overhead a full featured IDE like Xcode. We will be using Swift Playgrounds at various stages of the course. See [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/ca/swift/playgrounds/) to learn more.
