# ðŸ§  Swift Playgrounds

## Overview

Swift Playgrounds is a light-weight development tool built for iPadOs and macOS. Similar in feel to playgrounds in Xcode, it offers a _sandbox_ for developers to explore new packages and SDKs and a space for new developers to learn and explore app development without the overhead a full-featured IDE like Xcode requires. There are tutorials and sample projects available for developers of all skill levels and the convienence of using either an iPad or macOS.
