# ðŸ§  Swift introduction

Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language that supports both OOP and functional design. Swift is registered as open-source software under the Apache License 2.0.

Swift is the latest language and Apple's preferred language used for iOS development.

In 2019, Apple announced SwiftUI, which provides a framework for declarative UI structure design across all Apple platforms.

::: tip Note
Swift objects are not-nil by default. See [Designed for Safety](https://developer.apple.com/swift/#safety) in Apple's developer documentation to understand why this is important.
:::

Swift programming patterns include:

- Variables are always initialized before use.
- Memory is managed automatically.
- Array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors.
- Integers are checked for overflow.
- Optionals ensure that nil values are handled explicitly.
- Swift code is compiled and optimized
- Error handling allows controlled recovery from unexpected failures.

## Platform Support

Swift is available on on a number of different platforms including Windows, Linux and of course macOS. For this course we'll focus on using Swift on macOS to build applications for iPhone and iPad. See [Platform Support](https://www.swift.org/platform-support/) at swift.org for more information.

## Use the REPL

**R**ead, **E**valuate, **P**rint and **L**oop

The Swift REPL allows you to experiment with Swift from the command line on macOS, Windows and Linux. To use the REPL, open Terminal and run `swift`. Once the REPL is running, all of Swift's functionality is available to use.
