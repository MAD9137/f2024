SwiftUI is the latest user interface framework designed to work on all Apple devices.  SwiftUI uses a declarative syntax that describes 'what' a user interface should do.

SwiftUI offers developers a faster, simpler and easier workflow over storyboards and the legacy approach to building interfaces in Xcode.
