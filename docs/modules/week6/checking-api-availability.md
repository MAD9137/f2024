# ðŸ§  Checking API availability

Swift has built-in support for checking API availability, which ensures that you donâ€™t accidentally use APIs that are unavailable on a given deployment target.

The compiler uses availability information in the SDK to verify that all of the APIs used in your code are available on the deployment target specified by your project. Swift reports an error at compile time if you try to use an API that isnâ€™t available.

You use an availability condition in an if or guard statement to conditionally execute a block of code, depending on whether the APIs you want to use are available at runtime. The compiler uses the information from the availability condition when it verifies that the APIs in that block of code are available.

```swift
if #available(iOS 10, macOS 10.12, *) {
    // Use iOS 10 APIs on iOS, and use macOS 10.12 APIs on macOS
} else {
    // Fall back to earlier iOS and macOS APIs
}
```

The availability condition above specifies that in iOS, the body of the if statement executes only in iOS 10 and later; in macOS, only in macOS 10.12 and later. The last argument, *, is required and specifies that on any other platform, the body of the if executes on the minimum deployment target specified by your target.

In its general form, the availability condition takes a list of platform names and versions. You use platform names such as iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOSâ€”for the full list, see [Declaration Attributes](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Attributes.html#ID348). In addition to specifying major version numbers like iOS 8 or macOS 10.10, you can specify minor versions numbers like iOS 11.2.6 and macOS 10.13.3.

In addition to `#available`, Swift also supports the opposite check using an unavailability condition. For example, the following two checks do the same thing:

```swift
if #available(iOS 10, *) {
} else {
    // Fallback code
}

if #unavailable(iOS 10) {
    // Fallback code
}
```

Using the `#unavailable` form helps make your code more readable when the check contains only fallback code.
