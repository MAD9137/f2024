# Assignment A2

**Objective:**  
Develop a more advanced SwiftUI app that incorporates the original topics as well as the new ones. The app should demonstrate a deeper understanding of state management, networking, data persistence using SwiftData, and advanced SwiftUI components and techniques.

**App Overview:**  
Create a comprehensive "Meal Planner" app where users can search for recipes online, save their favorite recipes to a local database using SwiftData, plan their meals for the week, and manage their grocery list. The app will use networking to fetch recipes from an online API and SwiftData for local data persistence.

**Requirements:**

1. **Core Functionality:**
   - **Search Recipes Online:** Implement a search feature using an external API (e.g., TheMealDB API) to fetch recipes based on user input. Display search results in a list.
   - **Recipe Detail View:** Show the full details of a selected recipe, including title, image, ingredients, and instructions fetched from the API.
   - **Save Favorite Recipes:** Allow users to save their favorite recipes to a local database using SwiftData.
   - **Meal Planning:** Enable users to plan their meals for the week by selecting recipes from their saved favorites.
   - **Grocery List Management:** Automatically generate a grocery list based on the selected recipes for the week. Allow users to manually edit the list.

2. **State Management:**
   - Use `@State`, `@Binding`, `@EnvironmentObject`, and `@ObservedObject` to manage state throughout the app.
   - Ensure data flows correctly between views, models, and controllers.

3. **Networking and Persistence:**
   - Implement networking using `URLSession` to fetch data from the recipe API.
   - Parse JSON data using the `Codable` protocol to decode recipe data.
   - Persist data locally using SwiftData for saved recipes and UserDefaults for user preferences or app settings.

4. **SwiftUI Components to Use:**
   - Utilize `Text`, `Image`, `TextField`, `Button`, `List`, `NavigationLink`, `Form`, `Picker`, `DatePicker`, and `Toggle` to build the app UI.
   - Use `Stack` views (`VStack`, `HStack`, and `ZStack`) and `ScrollView` for complex layouts.
   - Implement `Modifiers` to style the text and images (e.g., font, color, padding).
   - Use `Animations` and `Transitions` to enhance the user experience (e.g., fade in/out for loading data).

5. **Advanced SwiftUI Features:**
   - Create custom views and modifiers to avoid code duplication and improve code reuse.
   - Implement custom animations and transitions to enhance user experience.
   - Use gestures for additional interactivity (e.g., swipe to delete a recipe).

6. **Data Handling:**
   - Create a custom `Recipe` class or struct to handle recipe data, including properties like `title`, `ingredients`, `steps`, and `imageURL`.
   - Handle optional data safely using Swift optionals and unwrap optionals where necessary.
   - Use SwiftData for saving, retrieving, and managing recipes locally.
   - Use functions and closures to handle asynchronous data fetching and updates to the UI.

7. **Additional Requirements:**
   - The app should follow MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture principles.
   - Ensure that the app is responsive and works in both light and dark modes.
   - Use Git for version control, with regular commits showing the progress of the project.
   - Handle network errors and provide user feedback (e.g., loading spinners, error messages).

8. **Submission:**
   - Push your final project to your GitHub account in a repository named `MAD9137-MealPlanner`.
   - Include a `README.md` file with a brief description of your app, setup instructions, API usage, and any known issues or future features.

**Grading Criteria:**

- **Functionality (40%):** The app meets all core functionality requirements, including networking and persistence with SwiftData.
- **Code Quality (20%):** Code is well-structured, follows Swift and SwiftUI best practices, and is well-documented.
- **UI/UX (20%):** The app provides a user-friendly interface and a smooth user experience.
- **State Management (10%):** Correct use of SwiftUI state management techniques (`@State`, `@Binding`, `@EnvironmentObject`, `@ObservedObject`).
- **Git Usage (5%):** Demonstrates regular and meaningful commits to the GitHub repository.
- **Creativity and Extra Features (5%):** Additional features or creative elements added to the app beyond the basic requirements.

**Deadline:** Submit your project by the end of Week 10. Late submissions will be penalized according to the course policy.

Good luck, and enjoy building your advanced SwiftUI app!
